# Border Electronic Queue Statistics

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Data Collection and Storage**: Collect and store queue changes in an optimized format from the *Belarus Brest border queue* [web page](https://mon.declarant.by/zone/brest-bts)

2. **Telegram Bot Interface**: Provide a Telegram bot with an interface to check queue statistics, including queue length over time, waiting time in queue, and other relevant metrics.

### Additional Features

The Telegram bot also provides administrative logging information, including:
- User statistics (number of users, request counts)
- Popular plot analysis
- Memory consumption metrics for stored queue data
